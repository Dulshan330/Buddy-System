# Buddy System Algorithm

This project implements the Buddy System algorithm for dynamic memory allocation using JavaScript. The Buddy System is designed to manage memory efficiently by dividing and merging blocks as needed.

## Features
- Dynamically allocate and free memory blocks.
- Minimize fragmentation with efficient block merging and splitting.
- Simulate memory allocation for various use cases.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dulshan330/Buddy-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Buddy System
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the simulation:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Observe the console output for memory allocation and deallocation details.

## Code Structure
- **index.js**: Contains the implementation of the Buddy System algorithm.
